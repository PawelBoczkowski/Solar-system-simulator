# Solar-system-simulator
Shorter and easier version of showing how planets moving around the sun.In my example i added two planets but my can add your own by creating new instance:
Planet nameofyourplanet = new Planet("nameofyourplanet", mass ,new Vector2f(PositionX,PositionY),new Vector2f(ForceX,ForceY));
